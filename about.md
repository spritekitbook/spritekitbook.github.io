Howdy!

My name is Jeremy Novak. I'm a Software Developer and [Apple](http://apple.com){:target="_blank"}  Enthusiast from Texas. 


My love of computers and games started in the [Golden age of Arcade Games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_age_of_arcade_video_games){:target="_blank"}. 

I am most inspired by what people like [Yuji Naka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuji_Naka){:target="_blank"} were able to accomplish and with such limited hardware. 

When not working on my trusty Macbook; I enjoy spending time with my family and friends and my dogs, working on my horsemanship, playing [Disc Golf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disc_golf){:target="_blank"}, and attempt some [outdoor cooking](https://www.youtube.com/user/krollins57/videos){:target="_blank"}. 


Thanks for visiting my GitHub.
